# Follower maze solution
The follower maze application creates of two main modules

This user-server application contains of two threads writing/reading the data from the same source.

##Client

* The main responsibility of user side is to handle the online/offline users.
* **ClientProcessor** created to process the user connected.
* The **ClientProcessor** is responsible to use **UserRepository** to add/get/getAll users (to interact with User
    Model).
    
* ###### What can be improved in the future
    * Add unit test for happy path and edge cases.
    * Save users (User model) to the database.
    * Add DAOs.
      
##Server
* The main responsibility of the server is to handle the events generated by the **client** side.
* Entry point of the events is the **EventProcessor** which is responsible to process the each event generated
by the **Client** side
* **EventProcessor** uses **EventFactory** to create a new event type based on the received payload.
* After successfully creating the event then only **EventProcessor** pushes the event to the **eventQueue** to be able
to run the processes concurrently and delegate the responsibility to the **QueueProcessor** to process the logic 
implemented for each events.
    
* ###### What can be improved in the future
    * As the payload can change the current solution is against of open to extend close to modify as we should change
    so many places, it is better to move the payload to its own module and uses its own data model.
    * Unit tests are missing for both success case and edge cases therefore it is making it hard to refactor the 
    provided solution.
    * Use builder to create **payload** there are fields uses the same type and the model is complicated can be also
    extended in the future, is better to use proper builder to make the payload.


##Queue

There are two types of queue in the application **EventQueue** and **DLQ**. 

Both queues are implementing an interface called **QueueInterface**.

* **EventQueue**
    * The main responsibility of the **EventQueue** is to process the main logic of the event pushed to the queue by 
    **QueueProcessor**.
    * The current queue saves all events in the variable.
    * The main responsibility of the **DLQ* is to process any malformed events, currently uses a variable to save any 
    malformed events
    
* ###### What can be improved in the future
    * Should either use **disc** or uses any **in-memory-data-structure** like **Redis** to handle any malformed events.
